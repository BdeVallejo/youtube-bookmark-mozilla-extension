# Intro <a id="intro"></a>

This is a version of the `Chrome Youtube Bookmarker` extension by [raman-at-pieces](https://github.com/raman-at-pieces) that I have modified to be suitable for Firefox.

This extension allows you to bookmark any Youtube video with a timestamp so that you can always go back to a particular point in time in a video.


# Project setup<a id="setup"></a>

You can clone this project with:
````
git clone https://github.com/BdeVallejo/youtube-bookmark-mozilla-extension
````

Follow this steps to add this extension to your own Firefox browser:

- Open your Firefox browser.
- Go to about:debugging.
- Click on `Load Extension`.
- Select your `manifest.json` file.
- Browse to any Youtube video.

# Updates <a id="updates"></a>

This is intended to be a work-in-progress project. New functionalities like Editing your bookmark with a customized title are on the way. I just need a bit of free time.
